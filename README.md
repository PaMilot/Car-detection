# Car-detection

This project is an introduction to object recognition in python using the framework PyTorch. <br>
detection.ipynb is no structured but <b>works</b>. <br>
<br>
own_model.ipynb is an <b>ONGOING</b> project. I'm trying to build a custom NN trained on my dataset, unlike detection.ipynb which is using a pre-trained NN : <b>faster R-CNN</b>. <br>
own_model.ipynb does NOT work, i am pushing versions so i can work from different workstations. <br>
