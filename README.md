# Car detection project

## Description
This project is an introduction to object recognition in python using PyTorch. <br>
It is a mean for me to put my foot in the computer vision field and apply techniques learnt
through the various online courses I took, and some college courses I follow.
I am also using this project to start reading more scientific papers, and implement some solutions into this project.<br>

## Files
- [detection.ipynb] is using a faster RCNN pre-trained model to detect cars on our kaggle dataset. <br>
- [own-model.ipynb] aims to create our own model to detect those cars. For now it is a CNN, that we update frequently and that we evaluate on an IoU score.<br>
This is an <b>ONGOING</b> project, the notebook is not well organized yet. (see kaggle repository to see more organized code)<br>
